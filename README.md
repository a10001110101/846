# 846
Purpose: Code used for converting 846 X12 to an Excel spreadsheet that can be emailed

Files are listed here as examples of my work using Python, PowerShell, and SQL.  File names and specifics about the ERP and 3PL these files are associated with have been removed.

Background:

These files were used for my company's ERP (enterprise resource planning) program to look for items in specific locations and bins, and compare that to my company's 3PL (3rd party logistics) inventory feed each night.  This was a manual process prior to creating these files, database/tables, and configuration in our EDI (electronic data interchange) program from Ramp Systems - Interchange EDI.  This entire process would run at 3am each morning, and email the company's production manager the information in an Excel spreadsheet.
